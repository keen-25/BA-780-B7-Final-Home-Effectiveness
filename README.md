Did a data analytics project on NBA play-by-play data to determine whether or not home team advantage is a real thing.

The objective of this project is to analyze NBA play-by-play and shot-detail data to uncover how team performance differs in home versus away games. By examining scoring runs, substitution patterns, shot success rates, and defensive effectiveness, we aim to reveal insights about game momentum, strategy adjustments, and overall team efficiency in different environments. This project will help us understand whether "home-court advantage" is driven by better shooting, smarter rotations, or defensive intensity
